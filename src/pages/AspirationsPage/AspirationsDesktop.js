                <h3>Independent Projects</h3>

                <p>When aspiring to be a developer, it is important to build your skills on your own. This can't be done
                    in
                    the classroom, it can only be done through independent research and experience. This can be done
                    through
                    personal projects, solving leetcode problems, etc. It is crucial that a developer is always
                    learning.
                    For this reason, I have started numerous projects on my own to build my knowledge. This includes: An
                    app
                    in JavaFX, this Website, and some indie games to name a few. Pursuing these projects have taught me
                    alot
                    about what it means to be a developer and to problem solve.
                </p>

                <h3>Education</h3>

                <p>For the past few years, I have been pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science at Florida Agricultural
                    and
                    Mechanical University. Before I attended this program, I had a vested interest in computer science,
                    however it grew stagnant. So much so, that I initially majored in architecture. Since changing my
                    major,
                    my love for computer science has only grew. Attending this school has made me more curious and more
                    passionate about the field. The more that I learn, the more I want to learn.</p>
